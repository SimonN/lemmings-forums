Please note that you must be at least 13 years old, or have parental consent, to sign up for a Lemmings Forums account. We do not ask for proof of age and/or of parental consent, but we may remove accounts found to be in violation of this requirement.

We do not have an explicit list of rules on this forum. It is completely at the discretion of moderators or administrators as to what is or is not acceptable, but the following three guidelines should keep you out of trouble:

1. Be nice to other members. (Arguments and debates happen, that is fine - just remember to attack the idea, not the person.)
2. Don't spam.
3. Don't post anything strongly illegal. (We tolerate abandonware copies of classic games; we do not tolerate piracy of modern games / software.)

It is impossible for the staff or the owners of this forum to confirm the validity of posts. Please remember that we do not actively monitor the posted messages, and as such, are not responsible for the content contained within. We do not warrant the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of any information presented. The posted messages express the views of the author, and not necessarily the views of this forum, its staff, its subsidiaries, or this forum's owner. Anyone who feels that a posted message is objectionable is encouraged to notify an administrator or moderator of this forum immediately. The staff and the owner of this forum reserve the right to remove objectionable content, within a reasonable time frame, if they determine that removal is necessary. This is a manual process, however, please realize that they may not be able to remove or edit particular messages immediately. This policy applies to member profile information as well.

You remain solely responsible for the content of your posted messages. Furthermore, you agree to indemnify and hold harmless the owners of this forum, any related websites to this forum, its staff, and its subsidiaries. The owners of this forum also reserve the right to reveal your identity (or any other related information collected on this service) in the event of a formal complaint or legal action arising from any situation caused by your use of this forum.

You have the ability, as you register, to choose your username. We advise that you keep the name appropriate. Use a complex and unique password for your account, to prevent account theft. Never give your password to another person, not even an administrator. You also agree to NEVER use another person's account for any reason. You also agree that once you create an account, you do not have the right to request that it be deleted or destroyed (but you may request that it be permanently disabled and/or that any information that links the account to your real-world identity be removed), and that any content you self-delete may be restored by administrators as they see fit.

After you register and login to this forum, you may fill out a detailed profile. It is your responsibility to present clean and accurate information. Any information the forum owner or staff determines to be inaccurate or vulgar in nature will be removed, with or without prior notice. Appropriate sanctions may be applicable.

With each post, your IP address is recorded, in the event that you need to be banned from this forum or your ISP contacted. This will only happen in the event of a major violation of this agreement.
